Project 1:
Run ClockTest.java
I did not use the csv file as per the assesment instructions, instead using a smaller file just to show the functionality is working.

Project 2:
CV.java is the example class set up as per the assesment instructions.

Project 3:
Run distance.java
It uses the distance table as defined in the assesment instructions.  It expects the x and y values (from 1 to 7) where x is the origin and y is the destination.  This solution might not be the most efficient way of doing it, but it is working correctly.
